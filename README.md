# Oblivion Skills Calculator
Calculator / Tracker for the game Oblivion to easily keep track of skill increases and how they affect each level up. Values get saved to local storage automatically, Level Up button resets all changes to default and clears local storage again.

## What I used
First time using a custom Webpack config to set up one of my small hobby projects I had laying around.
